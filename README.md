## Personalized Model Training

To enhance user experience, we'll implement custom model training using Databricks and the Transformer library:

1. **Databricks Integration**: For distributed computing and efficient model training.
2. **Transformer Library**: Leveraging pre-trained models from Hugging Face Transformers.
3. **User-Specific Data Collection**: Gathering interaction data, appointment details, and communication preferences.
4. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Personalizing language models based on your historical data.
5. **Continuous Learning**: Periodic model updates to adapt to your evolving behavior.

This approach allows the AI assistant to provide more accurate and personalized responses, tailored to your unique communication style and needs.

## Security and Safety

We're committed to robust security measures, especially for the upcoming phone integration, to ensure your data remains protected and the system is safeguarded against exploitation.
