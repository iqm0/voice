# AI-Powered Appointment Assistant

## Overview

This application is an innovative service designed to help users manage their appointments with ease, focusing on accessibility and inclusion. It's particularly beneficial for individuals with disabilities who may find traditional phone-based appointment management challenging.

## Key Features

1. Calendar Integration: Connects to Google Calendar to access user events.
2. Smart Event Analysis: Identifies events that may require cancellation, rescheduling, or special requests.
3. Business Information Retrieval: Utilizes Google Places API to gather relevant details about appointment locations.
4. Customized Communication: Employs a local LLM (or OpenAI) to generate tailored scripts for each task.
5. Natural Voice Synthesis: Integrates ElevenLabs for creating lifelike voice output.
6. Phone Integration (Upcoming): Plans to use Twilio for making and receiving calls on behalf of users.

## Technical Stack

- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- OpenAI API (for natural language processing)
- ElevenLabs API (for voice synthesis)
- Google Calendar API
- Google Places API
- Twilio API (planned for future integration)

## Accessibility Focus

The app is designed with accessibility in mind, aiming to assist users who may have physical, social, or mental disabilities that make traditional appointment management difficult.

## Future Enhancements

- Twilio integration for secure phone call handling
- User-specific model training for personalized assistance
- Continuous improvement of language models for better user service

## Personalized Model Training

To enhance user experience, we plan to implement custom model training using Databricks and the Transformer library:

1. Databricks Integration: Utilize Databricks for distributed computing and efficient model training.
2. Transformer Library: Leverage pre-trained models from libraries like Hugging Face Transformers.
3. User-Specific Data Collection: Gather interaction data, appointment details, and communication preferences.
4. Model Fine-Tuning: Personalize language models for each user based on their historical data.
5. Continuous Learning: Implement periodic model updates to adapt to evolving user behavior.

This approach will allow the AI assistant to provide more accurate and personalized responses, tailored to each user's unique communication style and needs.

## Security and Safety

We are committed to implementing robust security measures, especially for the upcoming phone integration, to ensure the system is not exploited and user data remains protected.
